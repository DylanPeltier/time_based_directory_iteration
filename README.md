# Time Based Directory Iteration with C++

As part of my COMP3400 class I was tasked with iterating through a directory based on certain time restrictions for the file creation dates. This is considered my first ever code written in c++.

## What I learned

This assignment proved challenging given that I had no previous experience with c++. I learned Java previously and that helped a little along the way (C++ lovers please don't hate me for that previous statement :D). This was also my first time using regex. Overall I learned that c++ can be meticulous in nature however, given the power that is granted to you when working I can see the need for all the little details and syntaxes. I enjoyed very much the challenge of this assignment and am looking forward to my next c++ challenge.
